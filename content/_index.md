    title: "Your partner in science"
    text: "We provide a high-end consulting and research service with the goal of supporting scientifically-sound responses to environmental and climate challenges. As data scientists, we specialize in integrating multiple data sources to explore and model water and environmental systems across scales, from which we generate valuable insights for the management of water and the environment. Capitalizing on our international network of academic experts, we also provide an interface between academics and other sectors to accelerate the transfer of the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge built in our research institutions. Our services target a wide range of stakeholders from the public sector and governmental institutions, private organizations, companies, and NGOs, and we provide ad-hoc support to academics."

            description: "Do you need to solidify the existing pool of knowledge on questions such as:
            - What are the current state and dynamics of the water and natural resources in a region of interest?
            - How likely it is to change with climate and other drivers?
            - What are the underlying risks and opportunities?
            Using data science and modeling tools, we build this information base that we believe is instrumental to the design, implementation, and assessment of any long-lasting project or strategy."

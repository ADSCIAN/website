  question: 'Do you wonder what <span style="color: #06a6a1;">ADSCIAN</span> stands for?'
  answer: 'ADSCIAN is the acronym for <strong style="font-weight: bold;">AD
          Scientific consulting and Environmental
          Systems Analytics</strong>.
          AD are our common initials, and we like it because “ad” means
          “towards” in Latin, which reflects our mission
          to support our customer work towards more impact. SCI is for science;
          AN is for analytics, et voilà: ADSCIAN!'
